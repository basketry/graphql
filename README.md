## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/graphql/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
